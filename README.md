Description
This is a fictional studio website which s a Moringa school Project build on html, css javascript and jquery.

# DESCRIPTION 
For this project, I created an interactive pizza ordering menu using vanilla JavaScript. The application allows the user to select from multiple different pizza options, including: size, crust, sauce, cheese, meat, and veggies. There are radio buttons for the user to select one option each for size, crust, sauce, and cheese, and check boxes for meat and veggie options. I wrote in logic so that in certain cases (where indicated to the user), particular options will add additional cost to the order. When the user is finished with creating their order, they click the Place Order button, which brings up an order recipt with the itemized cost of their various selections and a grand total.
